			Get number of seats
				Initialize variable for input to 0
				Ask for number of seats between 1 and 6
				Get input, repeat if invalid or out of bounds
				Return number of seats
			Row and Seat
				Initialize variables for found seats, start and stop in for loop, seat count
				If number of seats is more than 1
					Add one to count
				Else
					Count is 0
				Loop through seat array
					If more than 1 seat
						If current seat and next seat vacant
							Add one to count
						Else 
							Start over from 1
						If all seats found
							Add one to row then mod by max row
							If row is 0
								Row is 5
							Else
								Row is row
							Seat is seat position - number of seats + 3
							Seat range is seat position + 2
							Found seats is true
						Else 
							Found seats is false
					Else
						If position is empty/0
							One seat, mark row and seat
							Found seats is true
						Else
							Found seats is false
				Return seats found or not
		While no seats are found
		Calculate ticket cost
			Initialize variables for cost, seat price, total, and seat bounds
			Use section to determine seat price
			Total is seat price times the number of seats
			Cost is total plus number of seats times fees/taxes
		Display ticket information: quantity, section, row, seat(s), seat price, total
			If number of seats is one
				If section floor
					Print ticket info with flor for section
				Else 
					Print ticket info with number for section
			Else must have multiple tickets
				If section floor
					Print ticket info with floor for section
				Else
					Print ticket info with number for section
			Print service fee/tax using number of seats multiplied by fee/tax
			Print total cost
		Purchase tickets
			Initialize variable for purchase T/F, user input, start and end times
			Start time is current time at beginning
			Prompt for purchase yes no
				Repeat if invalid input
			Get end time after prompt
			If purchasing
				If within time limit
					Say total cost
					Purchase is true
				Else
					Purchase expired
					Purchase is false
			Else said no
				Purchase is false
			Return purchase
		If purchasing tickets
			Initialize variables for loop using seat range
			If the original seat is higher than range
				Start is the range (lower number)
				Stop is the original seat (higher number)
			Else
				Start is the orignal seat (higher number)
				Stop is the range (lower number)
			Loop through each ticket displaying ticket info
				If section number is floor
					Print floor for section number
				Else
					Print number for section number
		Update seat array with purchased ticket info
	While purchasing more tickets
	Calculate total cost
		Loop through seat array tallying seats
		Multiply num seats for each section by seat price
		Add all section prices
	Close pointer for file
Else file cannot be opened
